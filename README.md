# Steps to add the library to your project.

Just add jitpack to you project, in recent updates of android studio you might face errors. If yes try the 2 methods and also try googing "how to add jitpack to android studio version ---". If you need more help comment on our youtube channel [https://youtube.com/codeseasy](https://youtube.com/codeseasy)


## Adding jitpack to you project.

* Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```
allprojects {
        repositories {
           google()
           jcenter()
           mavenCentral()
           maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        }
    }
```
### Example of root gradle file
```
// Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.0.4"

        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
        // in the individual module build.gradle files
    }
    allprojects {
        repositories {
            google()
            jcenter()
            mavenCentral()
            maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        }
    }
}

task clean(type: Delete) {
    delete rootProject.buildDir
}
```


# Delete dependencyResolutionManagement from setting.gradle
For new android studio version you have to do this.
Remove these lines, everything inside the dependencyResolutionManagement
```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        jcenter() // Warning: this repository is going to shut down soon
    }
}
```


# Adding the library dependency
```
 dependencies {
 	implementation 'com.github.VishnuSivadasVS:Advanced-HttpURLConnection:1.2'
	}
```

- If you are facing issue with sync just go to file, invalidate cache and restart. Also try clearing the build and rebuild the project.


## Methods and how to use them
We have Two classes FetchData and PutData. Import the Library to your file first (In android studio paste the code and press alt + enter).
### Read Data From a URL - FetchData.class
You need to use Handler and post a Runnable. Inside the run method add the code for FetchData.

* Creating the object for FetchData, pass the URL as argument.
```
FetchData fetchData = new FetchData("https://projects.vishnusivadas.com/AdvancedHttpURLConnection/readTest.php");
```
* Calling startFetch() returns a boolean value.
```
fetchData.startFetch();
```
* To know when the process is completes use onComplete() which returns a boolean value.
```
fetchData.onComplete();
```
* If the process is complete, use the getResult() to get the result value.
```
fetchData.getResult();
```
* Full implimentation with Handler. You can also add a progress bar at the commended regions.
```
//Start ProgressBar first (Set visibility VISIBLE)
Handler handler = new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper());
handler.post(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        FetchData fetchData = new FetchData("https://projects.vishnusivadas.com/AdvancedHttpURLConnection/readTest.php");
        if (fetchData.startFetch()) {
            if (fetchData.onComplete()) {
                String result = fetchData.getResult();
		//End ProgressBar (Set visibility to GONE)
                Log.i("FetchData", result);
            }
        }
    }
});
```

### Write data with POST and GET methods - PutData.class
You need to use Handler and post a Runnable. Inside the run method add the code for PutData.

* First we need to create to arrays, one for field name of the parameter and another for the data. Make sure the order is correct.
```
String[] field = new String[2];
field[0] = "param-1";
field[1] = "param-2";
String[] data = new String[2];
data[0] = "data-1";
data[1] = "data-2";
```
* PHP representation, The post array will look like,
```
$_POST['param-1'] = "data-1";
$_POST['param-2'] = "data-2";
```

* Creating the object for PutData, pass the URL, method, field, data as arguments. The method can be POST and also GET.
```
PutData putData = new PutData("https://projects.vishnusivadas.com/AdvancedHttpURLConnection/putDataTest.php", "POST", field, data);
```
* Calling startFetch() for starting the process, it returns a boolean value.
```
putData.startPut();
```
* To know when the process is completes use onComplete() which returns a boolean value.
```
putData.onComplete();
```
* If the process is complete, use the getResult() to get the result value.
```
putData.getResult();
```
* Full implimentation with Handler. You can also add a progress bar at the commended regions.
```
//Start ProgressBar first (Set visibility VISIBLE)
Handler handler = new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper());
handler.post(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        //Starting Write and Read data with URL
        //Creating array for parameters
        String[] field = new String[2];
        field[0] = "param-1";
        field[1] = "param-2";
        //Creating array for data
        String[] data = new String[2];
        data[0] = "data-1";
        data[1] = "data-2";
        PutData putData = new PutData("https://projects.vishnusivadas.com/AdvancedHttpURLConnection/putDataTest.php", "POST", field, data);
        if (putData.startPut()) {
            if (putData.onComplete()) {
                String result = putData.getResult();
                //End ProgressBar (Set visibility to GONE)
                Log.i("PutData", result);
            }
        }
        //End Write and Read data with URL
    }
});
```

This is just like a pre-release version there are lot of other features coming soon.
